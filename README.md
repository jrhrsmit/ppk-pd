TODO: description
This project is an attempt at recreating the Nordic Power Profiler Kit with
some improvements:
 - USB-C connector
 - USB Power Delivery (20V - 5A)
 - Higher samplerate
 - Easily scritable interface
 - Current and voltage limiting
 - Voltage as well as current measuring
 - Remote voltage sensing
